## Getting it goin'

First compile any tools (litestream and lockrun). Note that litestream was last updated circa 2012 and it might build noisily.

``` shell
bin/setup
```

Then (probably needs to be run as root), get setup to run via cron:

``` shell
bin/install
```

This will create a /var/run directory for lockrun to use, and will then provide some /etc/crontab lines to add.
